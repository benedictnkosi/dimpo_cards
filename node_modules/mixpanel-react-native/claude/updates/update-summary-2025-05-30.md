## Key Changes

### Major Pattern Evolutions

1. **UUID Generation Pattern**
   - Reason for change: Enhanced Expo compatibility
   - Migration status: New implementation in place
   - Documentation updated in: CLAUDE.md, discovered-patterns.md

2. **Conditional Property Inclusion**
   - Reason for change: Prevent null values in API payloads
   - Migration status: Applied in profile data sending
   - Documentation updated in: CLAUDE.md, discovered-patterns.md

3. **Storage Module Resolution**
   - Reason for change: Handle both ES6 and CommonJS exports
   - Migration status: Implemented in storage adapter
   - Documentation updated in: discovered-patterns.md

### Architectural Updates
- No fundamental architecture changes
- Tactical improvements within existing design
- Enhanced Expo support strategy
- Improved identity queue management

### New Discoveries
- Gzip compression support added as optional feature
- `isIdentified()` helper method for identity checks
- Token-specific storage initialization pattern
- Enhanced queue management for user identification

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Teams should be aware of the new gzip compression option in `init()`
2. Consider using expo-crypto for UUID generation in Expo apps
3. Review conditional property pattern for cleaner API payloads

### Future Maintenance
- Next recommended update: 3 months (August 2025)
- Areas to watch: 
  - Further Expo compatibility enhancements
  - Network layer optimization patterns
  - Identity management improvements
- Documentation gaps identified: None significant
